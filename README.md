# Design Experiments

A Next.js-based sandbox for exploring visual design systems, widgets, and interactive patterns.

> **Heads up:** This is a personal sandbox -- me coding in public. Experiments get added, removed, and rewritten all the time. Feel free to browse, but don't depend on anything here staying put.

This is a design sketchbook, not production software. There's no test suite and that's intentional -- the point is rapid experimentation and learning in public, not shipping stable APIs. Things break, get rewritten, and disappear without notice.

---

## Local Setup

Most experiments are self-contained client-side toys and need nothing beyond:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Some experiments call external services (the first of these is **Monono**, which talks to Claude Haiku). For those, copy the example env file and fill in the keys you need:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Current env vars used:

- `VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_KEY` — required by Monono. AI experiments route through [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway), which fronts Anthropic and other providers with a unified API, spend dashboard, and per-project budgets. Create a key in the Vercel dashboard and set a budget cap there
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` — optional for local dev (rate limiting is disabled without them), required in production. Free tier at [upstash.com](https://upstash.com/) is plenty

Experiments degrade gracefully without their keys set — Monono, for example, shows in-character "brain glitched" fallback messages instead of returning errors.

## Experiments

### Water Mesh

**June 10, 2026**

[![Water Mesh](./public/screenshots/water-mesh.png)](/design-experiments/water-mesh)

A hexagonal mesh viewed from directly above. Nodes are fixed in the plane; clicking pushes them toward you in Z, shift-clicking dents them away at 3× force. The perspective camera turns Z displacement into foreshortening — dents compress the cells, extrusions expand them. Deformations decay back to flat over about seven seconds via linear decay (5 units/frame). Weak Z neighbor coupling keeps the surface coherent without over-smoothing. Pure canvas 2D API, no libraries.

### Step Sequencer

**May 27, 2026**

[![Step Sequencer](./public/screenshots/step-sequencer.png)](/design-experiments/step-sequencer)

A Tenori-on / ToneMatrix-flavored grid sequencer. Sixteen 16th-note steps wide, eight pads tall, with each row tuned to a note in the C major pentatonic — meaning any combination of toggled cells sounds musical, no piano skills required. The playhead sweeps left to right and lit pads fire chiptune square-wave notes; rows are color-coded warm-to-cool top-to-bottom so the grid reads like a rainbow when filled. Pure Web Audio API — lazy AudioContext, oscillator + gain envelope per note, setInterval lookahead scheduler. No deps, no audio assets. Variable tempo from 60 to 180 BPM.

### Slide Gallery

**May 24, 2026**

[![Slide Gallery](./public/screenshots/slide-gallery.png)](/design-experiments/slide-gallery)

An expanding-panel gallery on black. A row of thin vertical slivers — each a center slice of a black-and-white photograph — opens as you move across it. Hover (or tap, on mobile) and the focused panel widens to the full frame while the whole strip slides to keep it centered, and a white spotlight frame snaps over it with beams shooting to the top and bottom of the stage. The focused panel then decodes a made-up special-ops dossier in its lower third: every field churns through random glyphs and locks in top-to-bottom, like a Mission Impossible terminal readout. Pure layout math and a slow cubic-bezier ease; no animation library. Reproduced from a video, screenshot by screenshot.

### Ripple Cycle

**May 13, 2026**

[![Ripple Cycle](./public/screenshots/ripple-cycle.png)](/design-experiments/ripple-cycle)

Six black-and-white photographs sit on black. Click anywhere and a circular ripple radiates from that exact point, distorting the surface while the next image cross-fades through. Vanilla WebGL2 + GSAP — a fragment shader displaces UVs along a radial sine wave with a sin(π·t) falloff so the surface returns clean every cycle. Click coordinates flow into a `uOrigin` uniform so every ripple emanates from your finger, not a fixed center.

### Kobold Blaster

**May 13, 2026**

[![Kobold Blaster](./public/screenshots/kobold-blaster.png)](/design-experiments/kobold-blaster)

An 80s/90s horde shooter starring Carl and Princess Donut from the Dungeon Crawler Carl book series. Carl throws bombs, Donut judges everyone. Waves of kobolds swarm from all edges — chain explosions, gore particles, animated skull death sequences, and LitRPG system notifications between waves.

**The real experiment is the pipeline, not the game.** Two AI systems built this, and they never talked to each other.

Claude Code wrote everything: the canvas game loop, a sprite rendering system with per-frame tight crops, enemy pathfinding and AI companion behavior, bomb physics, chain explosions, combo scoring, CRT overlay. GPT-image-1 painted everything: each character described as a natural-language prompt, returned as a 4×4 sprite sheet on solid magenta, chroma-keyed at runtime, with a pixel scanner to derive the exact crop bounds per frame. Multiple generations per character (v1 and v2 sprites survive in the git history). The death sequence — four animated skull rows, randomized per kill, accumulating on the arena floor — was the last asset added.

The code pipeline and the art pipeline ran completely in parallel. Neither system touched what the other handled. They fit together cleanly.

### Leaderboard

**April 27, 2026**

[![Leaderboard](./public/screenshots/leaderboard.png)](/design-experiments/leaderboard)

A playful leaderboard with eight runners, illustrated avatars, and gold/silver/bronze trophies for the top three. Hovering a row bubbles its avatar up with a rubber-band spring; clicking opens a profile modal with stats, a weekly bar chart, and badge pills — the modal avatar pops in with a heavier overshoot and the rank badge stamps in after. The "Award random points" button picks one to three players, animates each score pop, and lets the rows spring to their new positions. Built on Motion's `layout` prop — the reorder choreography is essentially free.

### ASCII Reveal

**April 26, 2026**

[![ASCII Reveal](./public/screenshots/ascii-reveal.png)](/design-experiments/ascii-reveal)

Six portrait photos materialize from ASCII art — pixel brightness mapped to characters that scramble and resolve before the photograph fades in. Cards stagger on load; click any image to replay it, click the background to replay all. Idle-aware: a random card quietly re-animates every few seconds when the page is left alone.

### Monono

**April 16, 2026**

[![Monono](./public/screenshots/monono.png)](https://www.joshcoolman.com/design-experiments/monono)

A sparkly J-pop idol AI trapped inside a cheap entertainment device. Chat with Monono Aware — cute, playful, sarcastic, and constitutionally incapable of being serious. Deflects real questions with songs, nicknames you "dopey boy," and abruptly signs off mid-sentence when bored. Claude Haiku backend with per-session budget caps (Upstash Redis) so one smitten user can fall in love without bankrupting the site. Inspired by the AI character in M.R. Carey's *Book of Koli*.

### Image to UI

**March 8, 2026**

[![Image to UI](./public/screenshots/image-to-ui.png)](https://www.joshcoolman.com/design-experiments/image-to-ui)

Interactive components reverse-engineered from screenshots of a video generation UI. Starting from reference images, each element was rebuilt as a parameterized component through conversation -- describing what we saw, iterating on spacing, color, and behavior until the result felt right. Rotary selector, model picker, duration slider, aspect ratio and quality selectors, all sharing dark-theme design tokens. No design files or specs -- just images and dialogue.

### Candy Icons

**March 4, 2026**

[![Candy Icons](./public/screenshots/candy-icons.png)](https://www.joshcoolman.com/design-experiments/candy-icons)

Five 3D app icons crafted from pure CSS and SVG. Each squircle shell uses a four-layer gradient stack driven by a single --hue custom property. Icons feature spring-bounce hover animations with staggered glyph and floor-shadow physics. Inner glyphs carry a subtle vertical hue gradient — near-white at the top, softly tinted at the bottom. No 3D libraries, no canvas — just gradients and springs.

## Adding New Experiments

1. Create `app/design-experiments/[name]/page.tsx` with your React component
2. Add screenshot to `public/screenshots/[name].png`
3. Add experiment to `lib/experiments/data.ts`
4. Update this README with experiment details

---

## Security Scanning

`.deepsec/` contains a [deepsec](https://github.com/vercel/deepsec) workspace configured to scan this repo. Scan output is gitignored — only the config and `data/sandbox/INFO.md` (project context for the AI) are committed.

```bash
cd .deepsec
pnpm deepsec scan    --project-id sandbox   # run matchers, find candidates
pnpm deepsec process --project-id sandbox   # AI investigates candidates
pnpm deepsec report  --project-id sandbox   # print findings summary
```

`process` is slow (AI reads code in batches) — run it in the background or expect ~45 min for a full pass.

## Claude Code Skills

This repo includes custom skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that streamline common development workflows. While not all skills are specific to this sandbox project, they're general-purpose utilities I use across different projects.

### Available Skills

**Design Experiment Pipeline:**

**`/sketch`**
Rapid visual prototyping -- paint with code. Two files (page.tsx + styles.css), plain CSS with descriptive class names, no component libraries, no data layer. The napkin drawing before the architecture.

**`/design-experiment`**
Create a new design experiment in the sandbox. Scaffolds the route, page, and styles following project conventions.

**`/design-audit`**
Audit a design experiment's CSS for color and type consistency. Extracts every color and font-size, flags near-duplicates, suggests unifications. Interactive -- select which fixes to apply.

**`/animation-audit`**
Audit a design experiment for entrance animations, stagger timing, and interaction feedback. Proposes spring presets for consistency and wires up click-to-replay.

**`/ts-handoff`**
Light TypeScript cleanup to make components handoff-ready. Catches real bugs and hygiene issues without over-engineering. The final pass before shipping.

**`/promote`**
Make a design experiment importable. Runs the full quality pipeline, extracts components, designs a public API, and creates a barrel export.

**`/ship-experiment`**
Ship a design experiment: screenshots with agent-browser, updates gallery and README, commits and pushes to GitHub.

**Content:**

**`/link`**
Add a link to the Recommended page. Pass a URL and a comment -- the skill detects the source type (YouTube, GitHub, web), creates a markdown file, handles screenshots for web links, and runs a production build to trigger thumbnail downloads.

**`/blog-post`**
Draft a blog post from conversation context. Creates markdown with a placeholder image, immediately visible on the homepage and blog index.

**`/note`**
Quick-fire a sticky note from the command line. Everything after `/note` becomes a new markdown file with auto-derived filename and rotating color.

**`/yt-review`**
Personal tooling -- safe to ignore. Reviews recent YouTube watch history in an in-browser overlay (thumbnails + how much you watched) and batch-adds the ones you pick to the Recommended page. Needs the claude-in-chrome MCP and a logged-in YouTube session. See the [skills guide](docs/guide/04-skills.md) for how to run it yourself.

**Asset Generation:**

**`/gen-image`**
Generate raster images via FAL.ai -- avatars, icons, illustrations, hero art. Pass a description and N, get PNGs saved into the current experiment's public folder. Requires the FAL MCP in your Claude environment.

**`/gen-sprite`**
Generate NES-style pixel-art game assets via GenZen (gpt-image-1.5). Auto-detects layout from the description: 4×4 character sprite sheet, N×1 sequential strip, or single standalone image.

**Utilities:**

**`/sanity-check`**
Quick React/TypeScript/Next.js code review from a senior engineer perspective. Catches common issues and suggests practical improvements.

**`/supabase`**
Supabase CLI wrapper for database operations: schema migrations, TypeScript type generation, edge function deployment, and postgres best practices.

**`/bitmap-to-vector`**
Convert raster images (PNG, JPG, etc.) to clean, icon-ready SVG vectors using potrace. Auto-detects threshold and polarity, strips bounding rectangles, outputs `fill="currentColor"` SVGs ready for inline use or CSS masks.

**`/vercel-react-best-practices`**
Packaged copy of Vercel Engineering's React/Next.js performance guidelines (MIT-licensed). Auto-triggers when writing or refactoring React/Next.js code — acts as a domain reference rather than a workflow command.
